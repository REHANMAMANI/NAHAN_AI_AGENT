 Title: Shining in the Darkness

(Verse 1)
In the heart of the night, under a silver moon,
A story unfolds, a melody in tune.
A lonely soul, lost in the endless sea,
Yearning for a glimmer, a beacon to be free.

Shining in the darkness, a light so bright,
Guiding me home, through the darkest night.
In the echoes of the shadows, I find my flight,
With you by my side, I'll take flight into the
